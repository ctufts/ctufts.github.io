Over the last couple of years I have been doing a fair amount of NLP
work in my day to day. One of the methods I often use for dimensionality reduction and summarization of text is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of all the moving parts of LDA, I started writing a short gitbook focused on LDA and Gibbs Sampling. You can check it out at [ldabook.com](https://ldabook.com). Feel free to contact me via with comments or suggestions. You can also check out the [github repository](https://github.com/ctufts/LDA_Inference_Book)!

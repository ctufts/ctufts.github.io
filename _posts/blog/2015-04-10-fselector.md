I am currently working on the [Countable Care Challenge](http://www.drivendata.org/competitions/6/) hosted by the [Planned Parenthood Federation of America](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/). The dataset for this challenge has over a thousand features. Feature selection was used to help cut down on runtime and eliminate unecessary features prior to building a prediction model. The <i>random.forest.importance</i> function in the [FSelector](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FSelector/index.html) package was implemented in R to accomplish this task.

To demonstrate how random.forest.importance can be implemented, I used the <i>SAheart</i> dataset<sup>1</sup> available in the [ElemStatLearn package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ElemStatLearn/index.html).  The <i>SAheart</i> disease dataset is a retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. Patients positive for coronary heart disease, <i>chd</i>, are labeled with a value of 1 and patients negative for coranary heart disease are labeled with a value of zero.

The <i>random.forest.importance</i> function is used to rate the importance of each feature in the classification of the outcome, <i>chd</i>.  The function returns a data frame containing the name of each attribute and the importance value based on the mean decrease in accuracy.  

{% highlight r %}
> SAheart$chd <- as.factor(SAheart$chd)
> att.scores <- random.forest.importance(chd ~ ., SAheart)
          attr_importance
sbp              4.511806
tobacco         19.434096
ldl              5.959607
adiposity        8.099294
famhist         12.450121
typea            2.472882
obesity         -3.520101
alcohol         -3.420076
age             22.236682
{% endhighlight %}

The FSelector package offers several functions to choose the best features using the importance values returned by <i>random.forest.importance</i>.  The <i>cutoff.biggest.diff</i> function automatically identifies the features which have a significantly higher importance value than other features. <i>cutoff.k</i> provides the <i>k</i> features with the highest importance values.  Similarly, <i>cutoff.k.percent</i> returns <i>k</i> percent of the features with the highest importance values.  

{% highlight r %}
> cutoff.biggest.diff(att.scores)
[1] "age"     "tobacco"
> cutoff.k(att.scores, k = 4)
[1] "age"       "tobacco"   "famhist"   "adiposity"
> cutoff.k.percent(att.scores, 0.4)
[1] "age"       "tobacco"   "famhist"   "adiposity"
